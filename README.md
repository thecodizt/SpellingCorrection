# Leveraging Keyboard Layout Dynamics for Enhanced Spelling Correction
#### Objective: The aim is to develop a novel spelling correction algorithm that takes into account the dynamics of keyboard layouts to improve the accuracy of spelling correction.
## Methodology:
1. Understanding Keyboard Layout Dynamics: Study the layout of different keyboards (QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak, etc.) and understand the proximity of keys. The idea is that typos often occur due to hitting adjacent keys.
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of common typing errors that align with keyboard layout dynamics. This could be done by logging keystrokes (with proper permissions and anonymization).
3. Spelling Correction Algorithm: Develop a spelling correction algorithm that not only considers linguistic context (like traditional spell checkers) but also the likelihood of a typo based on keyboard layout dynamics. For example, replacing ‘i’ with ‘o’ might be suggested as they are adjacent on a QWERTY keyboard.
4. Integration with Existing Systems: Explore how this enhanced spelling correction can be integrated with existing text editors or word processors.
5. Evaluation: Compare the performance of your spelling correction system with traditional methods using suitable metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Expected Outcomes: The research would lead to a novel spelling correction system that leverages keyboard layout dynamics. This could potentially reduce the number of undetected typos and improve the overall user experience in text-based communication systems.
